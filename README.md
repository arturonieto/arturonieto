### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luis Nieto, a professional programmer and a dedicated engineer. Currently I am working on a personal proyect using RoR.
With over 6 years of experience I have been able to work with amazing people and different methodologies.
My last job I went from jr to mid to sr to tech lead and I realized how important soft-skills are.

### Expertise ðŸ§ 

Passionate about problem solving and logical thinking. Through my years of experience I have work on a big variety of projects, implementing solutions to real world problems that educational institutions face everyday (I worked for a Saas company designed for schools). Some projects lasted days, other weeks and others months, some of them were worked by one developer and one tester and others needed a more complete team.

Becoming the Technical leader of a new team was challenging but really enriching. I was pushed to improve my comunication and leadership skills and, eventhough it was not easy, I ended up enjoying it. Crafting the path of action when talking about software development is not an easy job and I admire and respect everyone who is proficient at this role.
